                    It may not look like much, but this is what started this whole project.
                    After one day of development, I had a broken panel system, placeholders for steps, and no homepage.

                    Once again, there were still a lot of things that needed changing.
                    Most noticeably, the homepage was looking pretty empty.
                    However, we did already have a working JS system in place, and user accounts.

                    This version was not long after the last one, but it included the ability to create projects for the first time and to have lessons load.
                    This was also the first time this project became known to Esporterz

                    This was the first version that was actually used by kids. We trialed this with four kids over the summer.
                    This version also gave a facelift to the homepage and added full lessons for the first time.
