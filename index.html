                    It may not look like much, but this is what started this whole project.
                    After one day of development, I had a broken panel system, placeholders for steps, and no homepage.

                    Once again, there were still a lot of things that needed changing.
                    Most noticeably, the homepage was looking pretty empty.
                    However, we did already have a working JS system in place, and user accounts.

                    This version was not long after the last one, but it included the ability to create projects for the first time and to have lessons load.
                    This was also the first time this project became known to Esporterz

                    This ones a little odd. At this point in time I wasn't releasing major updates like I do today.
                    This version was a bunch of small patches published over time. It was added as a release to mark the version before V0.4.0
                    I also consider this the "base" version of QCode. Also Paxton told me at some point that the website looked boring with all the grey,
                    so the iconic blue and green sidebars on the homepage are thanks to him.

                    This was the first major update I made for QCode. I never originally planned on adding a shared project feature, but kids kept asking for it.

                    Once again, released this update in the major update format I've been following. This one added the lesson chart system.
                    It was also around this time that Josh made a bunch of our foundational lessons.

                    Anyways, that's all we've done in the last year, and we have some fun stuff lined up for the next year of QCode
